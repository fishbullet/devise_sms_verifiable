Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Because DeviseSmsConfirmable module uses special methods of your ApplicationController to check if sms confirmation
      required and get sms secret you should provides ones. You can setup methods names in config/initializers/devise.rb, by default

       config.sms_confirmation_method = :sms_confirmation?
       config.sms_secret_method = :sms_secret

  2. Because DeviseSmsConfirmable uses special field of authentication model to get phone number you should provide one.
      You can setup field name in config/initializers/devise.rb, by default

      config.sms_confirmation_field = :phone_for_sms
